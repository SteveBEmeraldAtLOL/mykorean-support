  <h1>Privacy Policy – MyKorean App</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> [Insert Date]</p>

  <p>Welcome to MyKorean ("we", "our", or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our mobile application.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <li>Age</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This information is collected during sign-up and stored in our Firebase Firestore database for account creation and personalization purposes.</p>
  <p>Additionally, the app stores your language learning progress — including known words, levels, and test history — in <strong>Firebase Cloud Storage</strong>. This allows us to back up your learning progress across devices.</p>

  <h3>b. Authentication</h3>
  <p>Firebase Authentication is used to manage user sign-ins with email/password or Google Sign-In.</p>

  <h3>c. Usage Data (collected automatically)</h3>
  <p>We collect anonymized data about your interaction with the app:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>App activity (lesson progress, button clicks, navigation)</li>
    <li>Device identifiers (Firebase Instance ID, advertising ID)</li>
    <li>Analytics data via Firebase Analytics</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>d. Advertising</h3>
  <p>We use AdMob to display in-app ads. AdMob may collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device information</li>
    <li>Advertising ID</li>
    <li>App interaction for ad personalization (if allowed)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You may opt out of personalized ads in your device settings.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Creating and managing user accounts</li>
    <li>Tracking language learning progress</li>
    <li>Backing up and restoring your learning progress using Firebase Cloud Storage</li>
    <li>Displaying personalized ads (via AdMob)</li>
    <li>Improving the app based on aggregated analytics</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Google services such as Firebase and AdMob for functionality and ads</li>
    <li>As required by law (e.g., to comply with legal requests)</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>All personal data is stored securely using Firebase services</li>
